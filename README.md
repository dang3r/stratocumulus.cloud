# Stratocumulus Cloud
> A static website discussing all things stratocumulus

This project is what you get when:
- you realize `.cloud` TLDs exist
- you look up the top 10 :cloud:s and discover stratocumulus.cloud wasn't registered
- stratocumulus covers 20% of :earth_americas: and warrants having its own site (https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/stratocumulus)
